The most recent May 2012 release of Oracle Application Testing Suite (OATS) now has a Linux version of the OATS server. In the past the server was only available for Windows. In an effort to evaluate this Linux option, this project will prove these new install procedures as well the ability to keep a persistent OATS server hosted, on demand, in the EC2 environment.

Prerequisites:
1. An account with Amazon Web Services http://aws.amazon.com/

2. The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) service enabled (This may be default with all AWS accounts)

3. The ability to agree to the Oracle Technology Network Developer License Terms as they apply towards the Oracle Application Testing Suite, Oracle Database 11g, Oracle Enterprise Linux, and any other publicly available Oracle products contained in the packages.
