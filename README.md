The May 2012 release of version 12.1.0.1 Oracle Application Testing Suite (OATS) now has a Linux package of the 
OATS server. In the past the server application was only available for Windows. 
In an effort to evaluate the Linux option, this project will prove these new install 
procedures while allowing for a persistent OATS server to be hosted, and available on-demand in the Amazon EC2 environment.

## Prerequisites
* An account with [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/).
* The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) service enabled.
* Review the [Oracle OTN Downloads and License Terms](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/index.html) 
as they apply towards the Oracle Application Testing Suite, Oracle Database 11g, Oracle Enterprise Linux, 
and any other publicly available Oracle products contained in the packages.

## Instructions
* The documented steps to install OATS Linux on EC2 are here in the project 
[Wiki](/glennschler/oats-linux-ec2/wiki).
* An automated script is a consideration for future expansion of this project. 
This Wiki serves as the requirements for an automated solution.
